         <h3 class="pt-3 text-center">Malabar Giant Squirrel</h3>
         <h4 ><strong>LIVING REGIONS</strong></h4>
         <p>They are endemic to India and are found around Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and Satpura Range as far north as Madhya Pradesh.They are found at altitudes of 180–2,300 m (590–7,550 ft) in tropical deciduous, semi-deciduous and moist evergreen forests and woodlands.The Indian giant squirrel generally nests in taller trees with a mean height of 11 m (36 ft)in order to avoid predators.</p>
         <h4><strong>FOOD</strong></h4>
         <p>They mostly feed on fruit, flowers, nuts and tree bark. Some subspecies are omnivorous, also eating insects and bird eggs.</p>
         <h4><strong>UNIQNESS</strong></h4>
         <p>When in danger,they often freezes or flattens itself against the tree trunk, instead of fleeing. Isn't it a cute behaviour of these cute animals. The Giant Squirrel is mostly active in the early hours of the morning and in the evening, resting in the midday. They are typically solitary animals that only come together for breeding.</p>

          <h3 class="pt-3 text-center">Dugong</h3>
         <h4><strong>LIVING REGIONS</strong></h4>
         <p>Dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa,along an estimated 140,000 kilometres (86,992 mi) of coastline.Australia is the home to the largest population, stretching from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Moreton Bay in Queensland.The Persian Gulf has the second-largest dugong population in the world.Smallest population of them occurs in coast of East Africa and southern coast of China.</p>
         <h4><strong>FOOD</strong></h4>
         <p>They are herbivores and mostly feeds on sea grass, in search of which they go deep inside sea.They occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish.Dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases.</p>
         <h4><strong>UNIQNESS</strong></h4>
         <p>Dugong are also referred to as "sea cows" because their diet consists mainly of sea-grass. When eating they ingest the whole plant, including the roots,although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves.They can dive to a maximum depth of 39 metres (128 ft); they spend most of their lives no deeper than 10 metres (33 ft). Communication between individuals is through chirps, whistles, barks, and other sounds that echo underwater. Different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies, implying different purposes. Visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight.</p>

         <h3 class="pt-3 text-center">Snow Leopard</h3>
         <h4><strong>LIVING REGIONS</strong></h4>
         <p>Mostly found in mountain ranges of Central and South Asia.The snow leopard is distributed from the west of Lake Baikal through southern Siberia, in the Kunlun Mountains, in the Russian Altai mountains, Sayan and Tannu-Ola Mountains, in the Tian Shan, across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to the Hindu Kush in eastern Afghanistan, Karakoram in northern Pakistan, in the Pamir Mountains, and in the high altitudes of the Himalayas in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and the Tibetan Plateau. In Mongolia, it is found in the Mongolian and Gobi Altai Mountains and the Khangai Mountains. In Tibet, it is found up to the Altyn-Tagh in the north.</p>
         <h4><strong>FOOD</strong></h4>
         <p>The snow leopard is a carnivore and actively hunts its prey. It is an opportunistic hunter and also eats carrion. Its preferred wild prey species are Himalayan blue sheep, Himalayan tahr, argali, markhor and wild goat. It also preys on domestic livestock.It prefers prey ranging in weight from 36 to 76 kg , but also hunts smaller mammals such as marmot, pika and vole species.</p>
         <h4><strong>UNIQNESS</strong></h4>
         <p> Its broad paws well distribute the body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase the grip on steep and unstable surfaces; it also helps to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to maintain balance in the rocky terrain. The tail is also very thick due to fat storage, and is very thickly covered with fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.</p>

         <h3 class="pt-3 text-center">Red Panda</h3>
         <h4><strong>LIVING REGIONS</strong></h4>
         <p>The red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east. Its range includes southern Tibet, Sikkim and Assam in India, Bhutan, the northern mountains of Burma, and in south-western China, in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan. It may also live in south-west Tibet and northern Arunachal Pradesh, but this has not been documented.</p>
         <h4><strong>FOOD</strong></h4>
         <p> They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, maple and mulberry leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses.</p>
         <h4><strong>UNIQNESS</strong></h4>
         <p>Red Panda have false paws.They are even master at escaping.It sleeps stretched out on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its tail over the face when it is cold.This is again so cute.</p>

         <h3 class="pt-3 text-center">Indian Flying Fox</h3>
         <h4><strong>LIVING REGIONS</strong></h4>
         <p>he Indian flying fox is found across the Indian Subcontinent, including in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Tibet, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.It prefers to roost on tall trees with small diameters, especially canopy trees,and prefers to be in close proximity to bodies of water, human residences, and agricultural land.This habitat selection is highly dependent on food availability. </p>
         <h4><strong>FOOD</strong></h4>
         <p>The Indian flying fox is frugivorous or nectarivorous, i.e., they eat fruits or drink nectar from flowers.Although initially thought to be strictly frugivorous, it has been observed deliberately eating insects and leaves. The Indian flying fox also eats flowers, seed pods, bark, cones, and twigs. Their diet changes seasonally, with a greater reliance on mango fruits for moisture in the autumn and spring.</p>
         <h4><strong>UNIQNESS</strong></h4>
         <p>The Indian flying fox is so called due to its unique, fox-like appearance: reddish-brown coat, characteristically long snout as well as large eyes. And indeed, this animal resembles a little fox with wings. The animal exhibits small ears. Instead of using echolocation, this flying fox perceives its environment through well-developed senses of vision and smell, helping the animal to detect food. </p>
